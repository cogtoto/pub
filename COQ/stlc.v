    In particular, [E & x ~ T] denotes a context [E] extended 
    with a binding from [x] to [T]. The empty environment is 
    called [empty].

(** * Infrastructure *)

(** Before we start getting into the proofs, we need to set up a few
    more things.
     - functions definining free variables and substitution,
     - tactics to pick fresh names and to handle freshness-related goals,
     - a few axioms about the behavior of operations on terms.

    We will purposely introduce some axioms, so that we can go straight
    to the proofs that we are interested in. Once we are finished with
    the main proofs, we will do a second pass in order to turn the 
    axioms into proper lemmas.
*)

(* ********************************************************************** *)
(** ** Free variables *)

(** The function [fv], defined below, calculates the set of free
    variables in an expression.  Because we are using locally nameless
    representation, where bound variables are represented as indices,
    any name we see is a free variable of a term.  In particular, this
    makes the [trm_abs] case simple.
*)
Open Scope string.

  | app t1 t2 => (union (fv t1) (fv t2))
  end.

(* ********************************************************************** *)
(** ** Substitution *)

(** Substitution replaces a free variable with a term.  The definition
    below is simple for two reasons:
      - Because bound variables are represented using indices, there
        is no need to worry about variable capture.
      - We assume that the term being substituted in is locally
        closed.  Thus, there is no need to shift indices when
        passing under a binder.

  | abs t1    => abs (subst z u t1)
  | app t1 t2 => app (subst z u t1) (subst z u t2)
  end.

(** We define a notation for free variable substitution that mimics
    standard mathematical notation. *)

Notation "[ z ~> u ] t" := (subst z u t) (at level 68).

(* ********************************************************************** *)
(** ** Tactics *)

(** When picking a fresh atom or applying a rule that uses cofinite
    quantification, choosing a set of atoms to be fresh for can be
    tedious.  In practice, it is simpler to use a tactic to choose the
    set to be as large as possible.

    The first tactic we define, [gather_vars], is used to collect
    together all the atoms in the context.  It relies on an auxiliary
    tactic from [LibLN_Tactics], [gather_vars_with], which collects
    together the atoms appearing in objects of a certain type.  The argument 
    to [gather_vars_with] is a function that should return the set of
    vars appearing in its argument. 
*)

Ltac gather_vars :=
  let A := gather_vars_with (fun x : vars => x) in
  let B := gather_vars_with (fun x : var => \{x}) in
  let C := gather_vars_with (fun x : ctx => dom x) in
  let D := gather_vars_with (fun x : trm => fv x) in
  constr:(A \u B \u C \u D).

(** The tactic [pick_fresh_gen L x] creates a new atom fresh 
    from [L] and called [x]. Using the tactic [gather_vars],
    we can automate the construction of [L]. The tactic
    [pick_fresh x] creates a new atom called [x] that is fresh
    for "everything" in the context.
*)

Ltac pick_fresh x :=
  let L := gather_vars in (pick_fresh_gen L x).

(** The tactic [apply_fresh T as y] takes a lemma T of the form 
    [forall L ..., (forall x, x \notin L, P x) -> ... -> Q.]
    and applies it by instantiating L as the set of variables 
    occuring in the context (L is computed using [gather_vars]).
    Moreover, for each subgoal of the form [forall x, x \notin L, P x]
    being generated, the tactic automatically introduces the name [x] 
    as well as the hypothesis [x \notin L].
*)

Tactic Notation "apply_fresh" constr(T) "as" ident(x) :=
  apply_fresh_base T gather_vars x.

(** The tactic [apply_fresh* T as y] is the same as 
    [apply_fresh T as y] except that it calls [intuition eauto]
    subsequently. It is also possible to call [apply_fresh]
    without specifying the name that should be used.

Tactic Notation "apply_fresh" constr(T) :=

Tactic Notation "apply_fresh" "*" constr(T) :=

(* ********************************************************************** *)
(** ** Automation *)

(** Automation is crucial for avoiding to have hundreds of subgoals to
    handle by hand. For the tactics [auto] and [eauto] to be able to
    derive proof automatically, we need to give explicitely the list of
    lemmas that the proof search algorithm should try to exploit.
    The command [Hint Resolve lemma] adds a given lemma to the database
    of proof search. The command [Hint Constructors ind] is equivalent
    to invoking [Hint Resolve] on all of the constructors of the inductive
    type [ind]. We use [Hint Constructors] for all our inductively-defined
    predicates.
*)

(** ** Axiomatization of the infrastructure *)

Module AxiomatizedVersion.

(** At the point, we introduce two simple axioms and skip the many
    uninteresting auxiliary lemmas that would be required to prove them.

    The first axiom states that substitution for a variable [x] 
    commutes with the operation of opening with another variable [y].

    The second axiom states that the opening of a term [t] with a 
    term [u] can be decomposed in two steps: first opening [t] with
    a variable [x], and second substituting [u] for [x].
*)

Axiom subst_open_var : forall x y u t,
  y <> x -> term u ->
  ([x ~> u]t) ^ y = [x ~> u] (t ^ y).

Axiom subst_intro : forall x t u, 
  x \notin (fv t) -> term u ->
  t ^^ u = [x ~> u](t ^ x).

(** In order to focus our complete attention on the interesting proofs
    first, we add a meta-axiom to tell Coq that it should admit any
    subgoal related to well-formedness, i.e., any goal of the form
    [term t] or [ok E]. We will remove these axioms later on.
    This meta-axiom takes the form of a hint whose action is [skip].
    This hint will be triggered whenever we call [auto]. The [skip]
    tactics simply admits the current goal. *)

Local Hint Extern 1 (term _) => skip.
Local Hint Extern 1 (ok _) => skip.

(** It might also be useful to add an extra meta-axiom, to get rid of
    all the freshness-related subgoals. We do not need here, though.

(** * Proofs *)

(** Weakening states that if an expression is typeable in some
    environment, then it is typeable in any well-formed extension of
    that environment.  This property is needed to prove the
    substitution lemma.

    As stated below, this lemma is not directly proveable.  The natural
    way to try proving this lemma proceeds by induction on the typing
    derivation for [t].
*)

Lemma typing_weaken_0 : forall E F t T,

   ok (E & F) ->
   (E & F) |= t ~: T.

  apply* typing_var.
  apply_fresh* typing_abs as y. (* stuck here *)
Admitted.

(** We are stuck in the [typing_abs] case because the induction
    hypothesis [H0] applies only when we weaken the environment at its
    head.  In this case, however, we need to weaken the environment in
    the middle; compare the conclusion at the point where we are stuck
    to the hypothesis [H], which comes from the given typing derivation.

    We can obtain a more useful induction hypothesis by changing the
    statement to insert new bindings into the middle of the
    environment, instead of at the head.  However, the proof still
    gets stuck, as can be seen by examining each of the cases in
    the proof below.

    we obtain a nice and short proof. *)

    [binds] hypotheses. *)

Lemma value_regular : forall e,
  value e -> term e.
Proof. induction 1; auto*. Qed.

(** A reduction relation only holds on pairs of locally-closed terms. *)

Lemma red_regular : forall e e',
  red e e' -> term e /\ term e'.
Proof. induction 1; auto* value_regular. Qed.

(** The strength of automation comes from the following custom hints.
    They are easy to set up because the follow a very regular pattern.
    These hints indicate that to prove a goal of the form [ok E],
    it suffices to find in the goal an hypothesis of the form
    [typing E t T] and to exploit the regularity lemma [typing_regular]
    to prove the goal. Similarly, properties of the form [term t]
    can be extracted out of typing or reduction or value judgments.

Hint Extern 1 (ok ?E) =>
  match goal with
  | H: typing E _ _ |- _ => apply (proj1 (typing_regular H))
  end.

Hint Extern 1 (term ?t) =>
  match goal with
  | H: typing _ t _ |- _ => apply (proj2 (typing_regular H))
  | H: red t _ |- _ => apply (proj1 (red_regular H))
  | H: red _ t |- _ => apply (proj2 (red_regular H))
  | H: value t |- _ => apply (value_regular H)
  end.

(* ********************************************************************** *)
(** ** Checking that the main proofs still type-check *)

(** We conclude our development by showing that, with the appropriate
    hints being set up, we can recompile our proofs without changing 
    any single character in them.
